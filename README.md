B1) What Is class in Object Oriented Programming Language?
	In object-oriented programming, a class is a template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object.
B2) What is an object in object Oriented programming language?
	I n object-oriented programming objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process.
B3) What is difference between class and interface?
	Writing an interface is similar to writing a class. But a class describes the attributes and behaviors of an object. And an interface contains behaviors that a class implements.
B4) What is Method Overloading in objectoriented programming Language?
	Method Overloading is a form of polymorphism in OOP. Polymorphism allows object or methods to act in different ways, according to the means in which they are used. One such manner in which the methods behave according to their arguments types and number of arguments is method overloading.
B5) What is Data hiding in object Oriented Programming Language ?
	Data hiding is an object-oriented programming (OOP) technique specifically used to hide internal object details. Data hiding guarantess exclusion data intended or unintended changes and intrusions.
B6) What are the differences between abstract classes and interaces?
	The abstract class and interface both are used to have abstractions. An abstract class contains an abstract keyword on the declaration whereas an interfaces is a sketch that is used to implements.
B7) What are the virtual Func on in object Oriented programming?
	A virtual function is a member functions that you expect to be redefined in derived classes. When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived class’s version of the function.
B8) What is constructor in object Oriented programming?
	In class-based, object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables.
B9) What is Abstract class in object Oriented programming? 
	An abstract class is a class is a class that contains at least one abstract method. An abstract method that is declared, but not implements in the code.
B10) What is final keyword in object Oriented programming?
	The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-chageable. The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI. The final keyword is called a “modifier”
B11) What is pure virtual function in object Oriented programming?
	A pure virtual function or pure virtual method is a virtual function that is required to be implemented by a derived class if the derived class is not abstract. Classes containing pure virtual methods are termed “abstact” and they cannot be instantiated directly.
B12) What are sealed Modifier in object Oriented programming?
	When applied to a class, the sealed modifier prevents other classes from inheriting from it. In the following example, class B inherits from class A, but no class can inherit from class method or property in a base class.
B13) What is Dynamic or run time polymorphism in oops?
	Runtime polymorphism, also known as the Dynamic Method Dispatch, is a process that resolves a call to an overridden method at runtime. The process involves the use of the reference variables of a superclass to call for an overridden method.
B14) What is Access Modifier in object Oriented programming?
	Access modifier are keyword that are used in OOP in order to specify the accessibility of the method, classes, constructors, and other member of the class. Access Modifier is not a concept but rather keywords that are used in programming.
B15) What is friend function in object Oriented programming?
	In object-oriented programming, a friend function, that is a friend of a given, is a function that is given the same access as method a to private and protected data. A friend functions is declared by the class that is granting access, so friend functions are part the class interface like method.
B16) What is Overriding in object Oriented programming?
	Method overriding, in object-oriented programming, is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementations of a method that is already provided by one of its super classes or parents classes.
B17) What is the role of mutable storage class specifier?
	The mutable storage class specifier is used only on a class data member to make it modifier even though the member is part of an object declared as const. You cannot use the mutable specifier with names declared as statics or const, or references member.
